#' @description  The 87th dataset from the simulation study with 10 percent of observations were below the detection limit (BDL) based of a real epidemiological dataset. Out of 1000 subjects, fourteen correlated chemicals are completely observed (in X.true). In this simulation design, each chemical was simulated from independent normal distributions.
#'
#' BDLs were created using the bottom 10th percentile of the true data. Three covariates are considered:  the child’s age, the child’s sex (Male/Female), and the child’s ethnicity/race (White, Non-Hispanic White, and Other). After creating a model matrix, male white newborns (age = 0) serves as the  reference. The age is simulated from a normal with mean of 3.78 and standard deviation of 1.85 truncated between 0 and 8. The categorical variables are simulated from independent binomial distributions.  The outcome will be simulated using a logistic WQS model using the complete data:
#' \deqn{logit(\mu_{i}) = -1.25 + log(1.75)*WQS_{i} + 0.032*z_{age}+ -0.0285*z_{sex} + 0.540*z_{His} + 0.120*z_{other} }
#' where \deqn{ WQS_{i}= \Sigma_{j=1}^{c}(w_{j}*q_{ij}) }
#'
#'  with four of the 14 weights \eqn{w_j}'s being 0.25 and the rest 0. The \eqn{q_ij} refers to the quantile score of the \emph{jth} chemical in the \emph{ith} subject.

#' @format  A list that contains: \itemize{
#'   \item y.scenario: a binary outcome (1 = case, 0 = control)
#'   \item X.true: 14 chemicals; complete data.
#'   \item X.bdl: 14 chemicals with NA's subbed for the bottom 10th percentile of the true values.
#'   \item DL: The detection limit. Here, found to be the 10th percentile of X.true
#'   \item n0: A vector of length 14 indicating the number of non-detects.
#'   \item delta: A vector of length 14 indicating whether the chemical is observed (1) or not (0)
#'   \item Z.sim: A data-frame of covariates consisting of: \itemize{
#'          \item Age: A continuous covariate of child's age , simulated using normal with
#'           mean of 3.78 and sd of 1.85, truncated between 0 and 8, the maximum age of leukemia.
#'          \item Female: Binary variable child's sex, simulated using the proportion of females (0.42) by binomial distribution.
#'          \item Hispanic, Non-Hispanic_Others: Two indicator variables of child's race/ethnicity, sampled from independent binomial distributions  (proportion of Hispanic: 0.33; proportion of Other: 0.23).
#'          }
#'   \item time: the time it took to simulate the data.
